Java Quiz Application

NAME : MULE LAKSHMI NARAYANAMMA

A simple console-based quiz app built in Java as part of internship task (Task 8). This project is designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts in Java, including loops, control flow, collections, and object-oriented programming principles.

It provides a practical example of how Java can be used to build interactive applications that engage with user input, validate responses, and provide meaningful output in the form of a quiz.

Features
Multiple-choice quiz format with predefined questions and options
User-friendly console interface to input answers
Immediate feedback: Displays whether the selected answer is correct or not
Score tracking: Keeps a running score throughout the quiz
Final results summary at the end of the quiz
Easily extendable: Add more questions by updating the list
Tech Stack
Java 8+ (works with newer versions as well)
Console/Terminal for input and output
Project Structure

How to Run
Clone the repository git clone [https://github.com/lakshmimule333/quiz-app-java.git]

Navigate to the project folder cd quiz-app-java/src

Compile the program javac QuizApp.java

Run the program java QuizApp

Concepts Used
Loops

for loops used to iterate through the list of questions
while or do-while could be adapted for retry mechanisms
Collections

ArrayList used to store questions and options
List interface ensures flexibility in handling dynamic question sets
Control Flow

if-else used to validate answers and determine correctness
Can be extended with switch for menu-driven versions
Object-Oriented Programming

Class Question to encapsulate question text, options, and correct answers
Demonstrates encapsulation and modular code design
User Interaction

Scanner class for console-based input
Error handling for invalid inputs (future enhancement)
Sample Quiz Flow
===== Welcome to the Quiz App =====

Future Improvements
Dynamic Question Loading: Load questions from external files (JSON, CSV, or database)
Randomization: Shuffle questions and options for variety
Timer Feature: Limit the time per question for a real quiz experience
Scoring Enhancements: Weighted scores or negative marking for wrong answers
GUI Upgrade: Build a graphical interface using JavaFX or Swing for better usability
Multi-user support: Track scores of multiple participants
Learning Outcomes
By building this project, learners will:

Gain hands-on practice with Java syntax and OOP concepts
Understand how to handle user input/output in console applications
Learn how to work with collections to manage structured data
Improve problem-solving and logical thinking by structuring quiz flow
